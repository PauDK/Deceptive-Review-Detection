# Deceptive Online Review Detection

Ever since I come to the US half year ago, I do a lot more online shopping and rely my decision so much on the product review in those e-commerce platform. However, some of the reviews contradicted each other and perplexed me sometimes. It wasn't until I came across [this](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/18/technology/amazon-reviews.html) article that I realize that my confusion may casued by fake reviews and other people may also face the same problem. 

So, in this project I created a fake review detector trying a few models - Random Forest, XGBoost, and BERT transfer learning.
